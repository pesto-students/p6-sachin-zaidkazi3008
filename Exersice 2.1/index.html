        National Spread Joy Day, observed on October 11, is an opportunity to
        shift the tone of our newsfeeds and newsrooms from negativity to joy.
        Today, people are urged to surprise friends and relatives with a gift, a
        cup of coffee, or mail. The objective is to make each other happy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The day was initiated in response to the escalating negative thinking
        and hatred observed on social media, in our news, and in politics to
        effect proactive change in our communities. We can spread happiness if
        we concentrate more on the good. This is the message of National Spread
        Joy Day.

        <p>
          A little humor goes a long way to distract us from the awful reality
          in the world today, from natural disasters to violence and divisive
          politics. Spending time on social media has become taxing rather than
          empowering, which is exactly why Seattle-based firm Knack hopes to
          alter things by sparking a new social media trend that emphasizes
          love, generosity, and appreciation. Overwhelmed by the pessimism in
          newsfeeds, Laura Jennings, C.E.O. of Knack, wanted to demonstrate that
          there is joy all around us — we simply don’t talk about it much. As a
          result, she and the Knack team established National Spread Joy Day to
          encourage people to send gifts, carry out acts of kindness, and engage
          in more cheerful conversations.

        <h2 id="topic2">How often do individuals smile throughout the day?</h2>
        <p>
          We are born with the ability to smile, but as we get older, we grin
          less. According to research, youngsters grin 400 times per day on
          average, compared to the average cheerful adult who smiles 40 to 50
          times per day and the ordinary adult who only smiles 20 times per day.
